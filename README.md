pleasurehome: desiring queer space

Art Museum, University of Toronto

Over the course of 30 days, SPEEDRUNHOME.PAGE (2022) presents an HTML/CSS-constructed "speedrun" of queer spaces. This work is meant to be viewed from time to time, set as a viewer/users's brower homepage. Each day for thirty days it offers a refreshed set of poetry, images, and audio testimonials that reflect on how queerness is mobilized in the space of the day—alongwith the pleasures and discontents—in persuit of finding "home." Directly inspired by Ana Anthropy's 2008 video game the Mighty Jill Off, SPEEDRUNHOME.PAGE draws on the Girl in the Tower trope of many popular video games and fantasy stories by inviting viewers to refect on the pleasure of the process (Work) as well as the goal.
